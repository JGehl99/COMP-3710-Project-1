# Instructions

Inside each directory there is a "runner.py" file which allows for easily running that file to perform a given algorithm.

Running the "runner.py" inside the "GeneticAlgorithm", "HillClimber", or "TabuSearcher" directories will attempt to optimize the prisoner's dilemma problem using said algorithm with the passed parameters.

Running the "runner.py" inside the "Looper" directory is a helper method that will attempt to optimize the prisoner's dilemma problem for the genetic, hill climb, and tabu search algorithms for multiple memory depth.

Running the "runner.py" inside the "StrategyComparer" directory will play all algorithms against each other allowing for determining the best performing solutions.
